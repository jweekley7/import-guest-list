# Import Guest List for Google Calendar

Try adding 20 guests to one of your existing calendar events. I'll wait...
You must enter in 20 individual email addresses. Have a guest list of 50 people? Good luck!
This add-on allows you to take an existing list of email addresses that you already have stored in a spreadsheet and import them into the calendar event of your choosing in just a few clicks. 
Add an unlimited number of emails at once!
